## 🎮 **Game Concept: "ReRe"**

### 🧩 **Core Idea**
A browser-based, AI-driven narrative RPG where the player is trapped in a **time loop that resets on death**. Each loop gives them more knowledge, dialogue options, and clues about how to survive until the next day. The **setting is modular**, allowing for replayability and custom worlds (e.g., noir city, space station, fantasy village).

### 🧠 **AI Features**
1. **AI-Generated NPC Dialogue**  
   - Each character uses an LLM (like GPT or similar) with a **persona** and memory of prior loops.
   - Dialogue can dynamically change based on the player's previous actions—even if they "never happened" this loop.

2. **Dynamic World State**  
   - The game engine uses the player's past runs to subtly change world variables: NPC suspicions, items available, alternate routes.
   - Optional: fine-tuned memory graph to simulate consequences and world knowledge.

3. **Procedural Events**  
   - Events (murders, power outages, betrayals, etc.) can be procedurally generated or modified based on choices.
   - AI decides which clues are available, which ones are red herrings.

### 🕹️ **Gameplay Loop**
- Choose a setting (e.g., "Cyberpunk Megacity" or "Cursed Renaissance Town").
- Wake up at 8:00 a.m. with limited time to explore, talk to NPCs, gather clues.
- On death (or end of day), you reset—but retain **knowledge** and **dialogue memory**.
- Survive until the next day (e.g., escape, stop an assassination, solve a puzzle).
- Each loop reveals new truths or AI-created twists.

### ⚙️ **Technical Stack (MVP Suggestion)**
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind (for slick UI), game engine elements via Pixi.js or Phaser for interaction
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) or Node.js for game logic
- **AI:**
  - GPT-4 or Claude for NPC dialog + story logic
  - Pinecone/FAISS for memory vector search per character
  - Simple rules engine or fine-tuned transformer for event generation
- **Storage:** Supabase or Firebase for game state & user sessions

---

### 🧪 **MVP Scope**
- 1 setting (e.g., dark fantasy village during a mysterious plague)
- 3–5 NPCs with persistent dialogue memory
- 1 mystery/death event that loops
- 1 "true" way to survive to the next day
- Basic vector memory per NPC (prior loops, what you told them, etc.)

---

### 🔄 **Replayability**
- Multiple endings per setting
- Unlock new settings (sci-fi, noir, historical) after survival
- Let advanced players **create their own settings and characters**
